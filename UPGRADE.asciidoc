The parameters `VlanMap` and `RoleMap` have been added in `switches.conf`; be sure to add them in the [default] switch section.

The OAuth passthroughs will not be activated unless `trapping.passthrough` in `pf.conf` is enabled. Make sure you enable it if you have OAuth authentication sources (Google, Facebook, Github, LinkedIn and Windows Live).

Once the configuration is completed, update the file /usr/local/pf/conf/currently-at to match the new release number.

Upgrading from a version prior to 4.2.0

The parameter `guests_self_registration.mandatory_fields` from `pf.conf` (or `pf.conf.defaults`) was moved to the
default portal profile in `profiles.conf`.

The parameters `registration.gaming_devices_registration` and `registration.gaming_devices_registration_role` are replaced
with `registration.device_registration` and `registration.device_registration_role`.

Adjust your configuration files accordingly.

will need to be ported to the new architecture.

Once the configuration completed, update the file /usr/local/pf/conf/currently-at to match the new release number.

Upgrading from a version prior to 4.1.0
---------------------------------------

This release only fixes various bugs and doesn't need the database schema to be
modified. Simply update the file /usr/local/pf/conf/currently-at to match the new

Upgrading from a version prior to 4.0.0
---------------------------------------

Upgrading an old version of PacketFence to v4 will be quite
an endeavor. While it's entirely possible if done meticulously, we
suggest you start from scratch and move your customizations and
nodes information over to your new installation.

Database schema update
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The temporary password table has been extended to include roles information.
Moreover, an "admin" user is now automatically created. The default password
is also "admin". Finally, a new table has been added for saved searches in the
new Web administrative interface.

  mysql -u root -p pf -v < db/upgrade-3.6.1-4.0.0.sql

Other important changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PacketFence v4 received a major overhaul, especially regarding the authentication
sources. Authentication modules found in `conf/authentication/` are no longer
being used and have been replaced by the `conf/authentication.conf` file. While
this file can be hand-edited, you should create your authentication sources
and perform roles-mapping using the Configuation > Users > Sources page from
PacketFence's Web administrative interface.

Also, in PacketFence v4, the VLANs can be assigned in `conf/switches.conf` by constructing
the parameter names from the VLAN names and the `Vlan` suffix. The VLAN names must match one
of the default names (registration, isolation, macDetection, inline, and voice) or one of the
defined roles. If you were using custom VLANs, you must create a new role per VLAN and assign
them accordingly.

Other key changes were done, such as:

* moved remediation templates in `html/captive-portal/templates/violations` and converted them to Template Toolkit
* dropped guests_admin_registration.category
* dropped guests_self_registration.access_duration
* dropped guests_self_registration.category
* dropped guests_self_registration.sponsor_authentication
* dropped guests_self_registration.sponsors_only_from_localdomain
* dropped ports.listeners
* dropped registration.auth and registration.default_auth
* dropped registration.maxnodes
* dropped registration.expire_* and registration.skip_*
* dropped trapping.blacklist
* dropped support for resetVlanAllPort in `bin/pfcmd_vlan`
* dropped `sbin/pfredirect` binary
* splitted the httpd services in three: httpd.admin, httpd.portal and httpd.webservices
* domain-name is no longer required in each section of networks.conf

For all parameters related to authentication (categories, access duration, sponsor authentication, etc.),
you should now set proper actions in the `conf/authentication.conf` file.

Finally, the `pf` must be sudoer access to the `/sbin/ip` (and others) binary. As root, please do:

  echo "pf ALL=NOPASSWD: /sbin/iptables, /usr/sbin/ipset, /sbin/ip, /sbin/vconfig, /sbin/route, /sbin/service, /usr/bin/tee, /usr/local/pf/sbin/pfdhcplistener, /bin/kill, /usr/sbin/dhcpd, /usr/sbin/radiusd" >> /etc/sudoers
